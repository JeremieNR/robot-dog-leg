# robot-dog-leg
Python script that generates two outputs, one for each motor on a robot dog's leg, which is generated from an inputted math equation for the path the foot of the leg should take.

The code can accept any high level function, and the accuracy of the foot following the path can be change in code. Typically it will be around ~1mm accurate.
